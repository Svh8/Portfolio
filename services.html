    <h1>Services I Offer</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><u> Analysis & Visualization</u></b>
        <div class="desc"><p>
Analysis: I examine raw data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships. This includes using statistical methods, hypothesis testing, and machine learning models to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, analyzing customer purchase behavior or predicting future sales.
</p>
<p>Visualization: I use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, or Tableau to create charts, graphs, and dashboards that turn complex data into clear visuals. This makes it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand insights and make data-driven decisions.
</p>
            <p>Together, analysis and visualization help organizations see what’s happening, why it’s happening, and what might happen next — all presented in a visually clear and strategic way.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><u>Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning</u></b>
        <div class="desc"><p>Predictive Modeling: I build models that use historical data to predict future outcomes. For example, predicting customer churn, product demand, or loan defaults. These models identify patterns in past data and use them to forecast what’s likely to happen next.
</p>
<p>Machine Learning: This involves training algorithms to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Data scientists apply techniques like regression, classification, clustering, or neural networks to build intelligent systems — e.g., recommendation engines, fraud detection, or personalized ads.
</p>
<p>In essence, data scientists use predictive modeling and machine learning to turn data into foresight, enabling businesses to act proactively rather than reactively.</p>

        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><u>Data Cleaning & Preprocessing</u></b>
        <div class="desc"><p>Data Cleaning: I identify and fix issues like missing values, duplicates, incorrect formats, or outliers. Clean data ensures reliability and reduces errors in analysis and predictions.
</p>
<p>Preprocessing: This includes transforming data into a usable format — such as normalizing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. It ensures the data is structured and ready for modeling.
</p>
<p>In short, data scientists clean and preprocess data to ensure it’s high-quality, consistent, and ready for analysis or machine learning — making it a foundation for all successful data work.</p>

        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><u>Business Intelligence Reporting</u></b>
        <div class="desc"><p>Data Integration & Analysis: I collect and analyze data from various sources (sales, marketing, finance) to uncover trends, KPIs, and performance metrics.
</p>
<p>Report & Dashboard Creation: Using BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Looker, I create interactive dashboards and reports that visualize the data clearly for stakeholders.
</p>
<p>Decision Support: These reports help managers and executives understand what’s happening in the business, identify opportunities or issues, and make informed, data-driven decisions.
</p>
<p>In short, a data scientist supports business intelligence by transforming raw data into meaningful, visual reports that drive better strategy and operations.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><u>Big Data Processing</u></b>
        <div class="desc">I, as a data scientist, play a key role in Big Data Processing by handling and analyzing large, complex datasets that traditional tools can’t manage efficiently. I use technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and distributed computing frameworks to process massive volumes of structured and unstructured data. This allows me to extract meaningful patterns, trends, and insights at scale, enabling organizations to make fast, informed decisions based on real-time or historical data. Big data processing also supports advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and business intelligence across various industries.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><u>Data-Driven Decision Support</u></b>
        <div class="desc"><p>I, as a data scientist, contribute to Data-Driven Decision Support by transforming raw data into actionable insights that guide strategic choices. I analyze trends, patterns, and key metrics to help organizations make informed decisions backed by evidence rather than assumptions. By presenting findings through reports, visualizations, and predictive models, I ensure stakeholders understand the impact of their options and choose paths that align with data-backed outcomes.</p></div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><u>Building Dashboards & Automated Reports</u></b>
        <div class="desc">I, as a data scientist, support Building Dashboards & Automated Reports by designing visual tools that present real-time data insights in a clear and interactive way. I use platforms like Tableau, Power BI, and Python libraries to create dashboards that help stakeholders monitor performance and track key metrics easily. Additionally, I automate reporting processes to ensure timely and consistent delivery of insights, reducing manual work and enabling faster, data-informed decisions.</div>
